Open simp-chat-backend folder and open terminal inside

In the backend directory, you need to install all the dependencies for the backend/server to work, you can run:

### `npm install`

Once installation is done, you can now start the server by:

### `npm run dev`

Proceed to simp-chat-frontend and open another terminal inside, install all the dependencies for the frontend/client to work, run this:

### `npm install`

Once installation is done, start the frontend by:

### `npm start`

This will automatically open your default browser to the localhost:3000

During testing:

There should be two terminals active for the app to work:

Once both the server and client is active,

You should already be on the login page, use these credentials for the user 1

username: jharps_1
password: 11111111

Once your are logged in, open an incognito/private window/browser, visit http://localhost:3000

Once on the login page, use these credentials for the user 2

username: jgonz.7
password: 11111111

Once both users are logged in, you can now start sending messages from user 1 and user 2, vice-versa.

You can also register an account, must have a dummy photo to upload as a profile picture, you can use any dummy email as long as it is formatted as an email. ex. (mail@mail.com)
